Variables



Book layout, first chapter's page on even page number

Page numbering

The DITA-OT default processing use for bookmaps a double sided page numbering which 
means that chapters will start on even pages.

About the page numbering we want to use two different styles. In the first part of the user manual that includes the TOC, we want to use roman digits and after that we want to reset page numbering and use the arabic digits.
