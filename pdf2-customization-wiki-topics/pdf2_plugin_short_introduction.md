# Short introduction

First of all, ley me say few words about this customization: what is the scope 
and what we want to realize.

## The scope of this plugin
The scope of this plugin is to help people that want to start a PDF2 customization plugin. 
Before to start developing, it is better to understand how the plugin is organized, 
what technologies are implied by this, where to check for more information.  

## Customizations covered here
About the PDF customization, there are many customizations that can be done. 
This customization coves only some of them, but in my opinion, it is more important to understand 
how to make a customization, what are the requirements for this and 
where to search for more information. 

If you understand this, it will be quite easy for everyone to create a DITA-OT PDF2 customization.    

This customization covers the next sections:

1. Custom fonts

     Almost all companies have a set of fonts tat they currently used. 
     This is also true also for PDF documents.
      
2. Cover page

     Is it a book better with a good cover design? Yes, it is. 
     Cover and font customizations are the most common for PDF.
     
3. Headers and footers

     We'll see how to move them to the footer and also small tricks.

4. Chapter's first page
