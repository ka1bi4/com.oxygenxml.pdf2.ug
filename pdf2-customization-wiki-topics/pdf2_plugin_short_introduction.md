# Introduction

The scope of this plugin is to help people that want to start writing a PDF2 customization plugin. 
Before to start developing, it is better to understand how the plugin is organized, 
what technologies are implied by this, where to check for more information.  

## Customizations covered here
About the PDF customization, there are many customizations that can be done. 
This customization covers only some of them, but in my opinion, it is more important to understand 
how to make a customization, what are the requirements for this and where to search for more information. 

If you understand this, it will be quite easy for everyone to create a DITA-OT PDF2 customization.    
This customization covers the next sections:

1. Custom fonts

     Almost all companies have a set of fonts that they currently used and 
     they want to use these fonts for PDF documents too.
      
2. Cover page

     Is it a book better with a good cover design? Yes, it is. 
     Cover and font customizations are the most common customizations for PDF.
     
3. Headers and footers, PDF static content
     
     The DITA-OT PDF2 plugin generates chapter's title and page number in the header. 
     We'll see how to move them to the footer and also other small customizations.

4. Chapter's first page
     
     The DITA-OT PDF2 plugin generates chapter's title and page number in the header. 
     We'll see how to move them to the footer and also small tricks.


This plugin contains only a few of them  

**Note** This customization was tested with [DITA-OT 2.4](http://www.dita-ot.org/2.4/).
